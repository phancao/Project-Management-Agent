# Configuration Files

This directory contains configuration file templates and examples.

## Files

- `conf.yaml.example` - Example configuration file for DeerFlow

## Usage

Copy the example file to the project root and customize:

```bash
cp config/conf.yaml.example conf.yaml
# Edit conf.yaml with your settings
```

## Notes

- `conf.yaml` (actual config) should be in the project root (not in this directory)
- This directory only contains templates/examples
- Never commit actual `conf.yaml` with secrets to version control
