# [!NOTE]
# Read the `docs/configuration_guide.md` carefully, and update the
# configurations to match your specific settings and requirements.
# - Replace `api_key` with your own credentials.
# - Replace `base_url` and `model` name if you want to use a custom model.
# - Set `verify_ssl` to `false` if your LLM server uses self-signed certificates
# - A restart is required every time you change the `conf.yaml` file.

BASIC_MODEL:
  base_url: https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3
  model: "doubao-1-5-pro-32k-250115"
  api_key: xxxx
  # max_retries: 3 # Maximum number of retries for LLM calls
  # verify_ssl: false  # Uncomment this line to disable SSL certificate verification for self-signed certificates

# Local model configuration example:

# Ollama (Tested and supported for local development)
# BASIC_MODEL:
#   base_url: "http://localhost:11434/v1"  # Ollama OpenAI compatible endpoint

#   api_key: "ollama"  # Ollama doesn't need real API key
#   max_retries: 3
#   verify_ssl: false  # Local deployment usually doesn't need SSL verification

# To use Google Ai Studio as your basic platform:
# BASIC_MODEL:
#   platform: "google_aistudio"
